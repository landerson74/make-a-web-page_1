      5 Ways of Thinking Like a Programmer
    </h3>
      <ul class = "one">
        <li>Procedural Thinking - creating prefectly clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.</li>
        <li>Abstract Thinking - finding the similarity or generality amongst seemingly different things</li>
        <li>Systematic Debugging - relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program to not to work.  When a program doesn't work, it's because there is a mistake/bug somewhere in the computer code.</li>
        <li>Technological Empathy - comes in many forms.  For example, computer empathy is the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works, and what its good and bad at doing.</li>
        <li>Systems Thinking - happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces.</li>

        <li><em>Attibute</em> - This is a property of an HTML element.

      HTML and CSS are both "languages".
      HTML,<em>Hypertext Markup Language, </em>controls the structure of the webpage and 
      CSS, <em> Cascading Style Sheets,</em> controls the style of the  page; how it works.
      When programmers talk about the "DOM" <em>Document Object Model</em> they are talking about the <b>tree-like</b> structure of a page.
